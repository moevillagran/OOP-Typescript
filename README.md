# OOP-Typescript
Here you will find a glossary of key OOP terms and Typescript examples.
01. Abstraction
Objects in an OOP language provide an abstraction that hides the internal implementation details. Similar to the coffee machine in your kitchen, you just need to know which methods of the object are available to call and which input parameters are needed to trigger a specific operation. But you don’t need to understand how this method is implemented and which kinds of actions it has to perform to create the expected result.

02. Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class. For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her parents. With inheritance, we can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class. Hence, inheritance facilitates Reusability and is an important concept of OOPs.

03. Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the ability of any data to be processed in more than one form. The word itself indicates the meaning as poly means many and morphism means types. Polymorphism is one of the most important concept of object oriented programming language. The most common use of polymorphism in object-oriented programming occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object. Here we will see how to represent any function in many types and many forms. 

Real life example of polymorphism, a person at the same time can have different roles to play in life. Like a woman at the same time is a mother, a wife, an employee and a daughter. So the same person has to have many features but has to implement each as per the situation and the condition. Polymorphism is considered as one of the important features of Object Oriented Programming. 

04. Encapsulation
Refers to the bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit. Many programming languages use encapsulation frequently in the form of classes. A class is a program-code-template that allows developers to create an object that has both variables (data) and behaviors (functions or methods). A class is an example of encapsulation in computer science in that it consists of data and methods that have been bundled into a single unit. 

Encapsulation may also refer to a mechanism of restricting the direct access to some components of an object, such that users cannot access state values for all of the variables of a particular object. Encapsulation can be used to hide both data members and data functions or methods associated with an instantiated class or object.

05. Class
In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

06. Object
An object, in object-oriented programming (OOP), is an abstract data type created by a developer. It can include multiple properties and methods and may even contain other objects. In most programming languages, objects are defined as classes.

Objects provide a structured approach to programming. By defining a dataset as a custom object, a developer can easily create multiple similar objects and modify existing objects within a program. Additionally, objects provide "encapsulation," meaning the data within an object is protected from being modified or destroyed by other functions or methods unless explicitly allowed.

07. Instance
In object-oriented programming (OOP), an instance is a specific realization of any object. An object may be different in several ways, and each realized variation of that object is an instance. The creation of a realized instance is called instantiation.


08. Interface
Interface is a structure that defines the contract in your application. It defines the syntax for classes to follow. Classes that are derived from an interface must follow the structure provided by their interface.


09. Access Modifiers
Access modifiers define what classes can access an attribute or method. They also affect the entities and attributes that you can access within an inheritance hierarchy.

Here’s is a quick overview of the different modifiers:
- Private attributes or methods can only be accessed within the same class.
- Attributes and methods without an access modifier can be accessed within the same class, and by all other classes within the same package.
- Protected attributes or methods can be accessed within the same class, by all classes within the same package, and by all subclasses.
- Public attributes and methods can be accessed by all classes.


10. Constructors
It is a special type of subroutine called to create an object. It prepares the new object for use, often accepting arguments that the constructor uses to set required member variables.
